# Enterprise-Network-Design
This repository showcases a project on building a robust, scalable, and secure network infrastructure for a small organization using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The network design incorporates advanced networking techniques, ensuring high performance, security, and redundancy.

## Project Overview
- **Title**: Building of a Network using Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Objective**: To design and implement a hierarchical, secure, and scalable network infrastructure for a multi-floor organization with eight departments.


## Key Features
- **Hierarchical Network Design**: Utilizes layered topology with redundancy and star topology for end devices.
- **Security Implementation**:
  - VLAN segmentation for departmental isolation.
  - SSH for secure remote access.
  - NAT for private IP protection.
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs) for access filtering.
- **Dynamic Configurations**:
  - DHCP for automatic IP allocation.
  - OSPF for dynamic routing between subnets.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Enabled via Router-on-a-Stick configuration.
- **Link Aggregation**: EtherChannel technology to enhance redundancy and bandwidth efficiency.
- **Wireless Access**: Implemented with access points for network coverage.
- **Server Configurations**:
  - Web, email, and file servers for organizational operations.
  - Remote access and management enabled for IT staff.


## Technologies Used
- **Tools**: Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Protocols**: OSPF, VLAN, NAT, DHCP
- **Security**: ACLs, 


## Results
- Successfully tested communication between devices within and outside the organization.
- Efficient resource sharing (e.g., printers, servers) with 0% packet loss.
- Fully operational email and file servers with verified external access.
